---------------------------------------------------------------------

statically typed : 

if you want to declare a variable, you have to specify the type of the variable
int a = 10; 4bytes
float x = 10.20
c, c++, java, c#

dynamically typed :

if you want to declare a variable, you dont  have to specify the type of the variable

no = 100

python ,js

.py



int a = 100
int b = 100.20

implicit type conversion
print(100)


find how to input false in bool

operators: operators are special symbols that perform operations on operands

type of operators :
1) unary operators
    it requires only one operand
    ++a , a++

2) binary operators
    it requires two operands a + b 


1) arithmetic operators
    +, -, *, /, %,     //, **
2) relational operators
    <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
3) logical operators
    and, or, not
4) bitwise operators
    &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
5) assignment operators
    =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=
    
6) membership operators
    in, not in
7) identity operators
    is, is not                        



3) ternary operators
    it requires three operands
    a ? b : c


decision making statements:
if else
match case
loops:

{

}

ARRAY is group of similar type of elements
1)list
2)tuple
3)set
4)dictionary


1)list is mutable
2)list is ordered, and indexed
3)list allows duplicate elements
4)list allows hetrogenous elements [12,34,56,77.88,"pl",false]
5)list is represented by []
6)list is dynamic
7)list is growable [10,20,30] --add --> [10,20,30,40]
8)list is iterable --> iterate...
9)list is shrinkable [10,20,30,40] --remove --> [10,20,30]
10)dat type of list is list

functions:

function is block of code which is used to perform a specific task
use of function:
1)resuability
2)modularity
3)code optimization
4)code readability
5)code maintainability


50 line of code..... 

4 5.... 250 -->

wrap[] function call...
--------------------------

modularity:


3)code optimization

10 line of code --> 10 times -->

button create ---> 100 license
color -->red-->

100 times


type of functions:

built-in functions :print,input ....
user-defined functions : functions created by user

with return type with arguments
with return type without arguments
without return type with arguments
without return type without arguments

int sum
void sum
float marks

def keyword is used to define a function



pass string in function check weather it is palindrome or not if its return true or false



create a function which will take 2 number as an arguments

task:1
1st parameter should be a palindrome number
2nd parameter should be a prime number
------------------
task:2
create 2 string param in lamnda concat it and check how many vowels are there in the string
------------------
task:3
take 2 string param 
1 param is sentence and 2nd param is word
find a word if it is present in the sentence or not
if its then return index of the word
"hi this is india, india is my country" ,"ok"
------------------
task4:
take 3 number param and find the max number

decorators:
decorators are used to add some extra functionality to the existing function 
without changing the function

decorators will take a function as an argument and return a function

find all player who not hit any six 
find all player  and more balls and hit 4 and 6 both

FILES:
to store data permanently we can use file or database


open
read/write
close

---------------------------
cpp --> file handling --> class --> ifstream, ofstream, fstream
//ifstream --> read
//ofstream --> write
//fstream --> read/write

c language --> file handling --> modes 
//r read mode  --> file should be present
//w write mode --> file should be created
//a append mode --> file should be created
//r+ read/write mode --> file should be present
//w+ write/read mode --> file should be created
//a+ append/read mode --> file should be created

//x exclusive mode --> file should not be present

--------------------------------------------------
paths
absolute path --> full path D:\royal\23dailyclubfast\th.txt
relative path --> ./th.txt

./ current directory
../ parent directory
../../ grand parent directory
../../../ great grand parent directory

cd changing directory

class : class is data member and member function
