2 types of loops are  there
1)entry controlled loop
    :for while
python supports only entry controlled loop


for --> when we know the no of iterations in advance
while --> when we dont know the no of iterations in advance
2)exit controlled loop
    :do while

i =0; initialization
i<10; condition
i++ increment/decrement
for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
{
    
}

range()
